# 'The Who'- First Milestone Project
The aim of the 'User Centric' end of module project was to create a website for a band based in 1960's. The website should reflect coding skills gained in HTML and CSS.
This website is created as a fan-page for 'THE WHO' fans showcasing; photos, audio clips and videos of performances by 'The WHO' which are embedded into the website. The website provides an option for fans to hire 'The WHO' for events such as weddings and Christmas parties if they wish to and to increase its fanbase.

## User Experience
The website aims to inform users of when tours are taking place for the band and showcases there work in the form of video clips and audio tracks. The website has a navigation bar to direct fans who may wish to ; view photos of the band, listen to audio clips of the band, watch video performances of the band and who may wish to hire 'THE WHO' band  for events such as weddings and Christmas parties through contacting them via the contact form. The footer section of the website provides links to social media where fans can follow the band on social media.

[Wireframes](/assets/wireframes/Who.pdf)

Changes noted from the wireframes to the actual website include;
<ul>
<li> List of titles for the; audio, gallery and video section implemented for the user to understand what these sections show.
<li> Transparent  container background colours were used in order for the user to still visualise the background image; the jumbotron on the first page is a transparent blue as well as the band members container on the hire us page in order to match the colour scheme , the tour dates container, sample tracks container, 'happy jack' video container  and  form container are all transparent black to match the colour scheme.
</ul>


## Features
The website contains five pages; Home Page, Gallery, Audio, Video and Hire Us pages. All five pages contain the same header and footer element with the; logo, social links and copyright message to maintain consistency of design throughout. All of the webpages also have the same background image of 'The WHO' for consistency as well.On large and medium devices, the audio clips, gallery photos and video clips on the website are arranged from left to right and on small devices such as mobile phone the audio clips are arranged vertically on the website.
<ul>

</ul>

## Technologies used

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5"> HTML5 </a></li> HTML 5 was used to create the structure of webpage with the necessary elements
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html"> CSS3 </a></li> CSS3 was used to write custom css style the webpage with the necessay attributes.
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap </a> </li>  The Bootstrap framework is used to style the webpage alongside custom css and the grid system is adhered to.
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/"> Jquery </a> </li> Jquery was used to create the collapsible navbar in toggle mode for mobile devices.
</ul>

## Testing and Validating

The HTML and CSS3 codes were validated on WSC validator and no syntax errors were found. The website was tested at various screen sizes which include mobile and tablet devices. The 'tour dates table' on the homepage was found to be responsive on mobile devices, however the user would have to scroll across to visualise it completely as the table is too wide to fit on mobiles devices. Appropriate media queries were put into place to enable the webpages to appear correctly on mobile and tablet devices.
The Hire Us contact form was filled out by me to check that the form is not sent till all the required fields are completed and a valid email address is inputted.
The website was found to work adequately on Github and in responsive mode for tablets and mobiles.

The website has been found to be fully functional and has been tested on the following browsers:

<ul>
<li> Google Chrome </li>
<li> Microsoft Edge </li>
<li> Mozilla Firefox </li>
<li> Opera </li>
</ul>

The website was tested on the following devices and the website was found to display all the coded elements and attributes:
